# Checkers

Place each checker for this service in its own directory here.
The name of the checkers (directories) will determine what is shown on the scoreboard.
If there is only one checker, name it the same as the name of the service.

To start each checker, copy a template from the `./templates` directory, plaste in this directory, and rename it to the checker's name.
Then, paste the checker into that directory.  Do not modify the contents of the `./docker` directory.
